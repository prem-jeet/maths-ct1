# Once upon a time there was a kingdom whose people were strange. These people either always told the truth or always told lies and they responded to questions only with a “yes” or “no”. Suppose, in a parallel universe of time travel, you ended up there as a tourist and came to a fork in the road while travelling to the capital. One branch of this fork led to the capital but the other one did not. There was no sign indicating which branch to take, but there was one old lady, Ms. Y standing in the fork. What single question should you ask her to determine which branch to take?

### Answer

In this scenario, you can ask Ms. Y the following question:

**"If I asked you whether the left branch leads to the capital, would you say yes?"**

### Explanation:

- If Ms. Y is a truth-teller:
  - If the left branch leads to the capital, she would truthfully respond "yes" to both your question and the hypothetical question.
  - If the left branch does not lead to the capital, she would truthfully respond "no" to both questions.

- If Ms. Y is a liar:
  - If the left branch leads to the capital, she would falsely respond "no" to the hypothetical question. However, since she lies, she would say "yes" to your actual question.
  - If the left branch does not lead to the capital, she would falsely respond "yes" to the hypothetical question. Since she lies, she would say "no" to your actual question.

### Conclusion:
- Regardless of whether Ms. Y is a truth-teller or a liar:
  - If she answers "yes," the left branch leads to the capital.
  - If she answers "no," the left branch does not lead to the capital.

This question allows you to determine which branch to take without needing to know whether Ms. Y always tells the truth or always lies.
