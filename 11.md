Let \( p, q, \) and \( r \) be the propositions such that:

- \( p \): You get an A on the final exam.
- \( q \): You do every exercise in this paper.
- \( r \): You get an A in this class.

### Write these propositions using \( p, q, \) and \( r \) and logical connectives (including negations).

a. You get an A in this class, but you do not do every exercise in this paper.

b. You get an A on the final, you do every exercise in this paper, and you get an A in this class.

c. To get an A in this class, it is necessary for you to get an A on the final.

d. You get an A on the final, but you don’t do every exercise in this paper; nevertheless, you get an A in this class.

e. Getting an A on the final and doing every exercise in this paper is sufficient for getting an A in this class.

f. You will get an A in this class if you get an A on the final exam.

### Propositions:

a. You get an A in this class, but you do not do every exercise in this paper.
- Logical Expression: \( r \land \neg q \)

b. You get an A on the final, you do every exercise in this paper, and you get an A in this class.
- Logical Expression: \( p \land q \land r \)

c. To get an A in this class, it is necessary for you to get an A on the final.
- Logical Expression: \( r \rightarrow p \)

d. You get an A on the final, but you don’t do every exercise in this paper; nevertheless, you get an A in this class.
- Logical Expression: \( p \land \neg q \land r \)

e. Getting an A on the final and doing every exercise in this paper is sufficient for getting an A in this class.
- Logical Expression: \( (p \land q) \rightarrow r \)

f. You will get an A in this class if you get an A on the final exam.
- Logical Expression: \( p \rightarrow r \)
