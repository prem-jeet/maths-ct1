# Define Propositional logic. How is it different from the Predicate Logic?

### Propositional Logic (PL)

Propositional Logic, also known as sentential logic or boolean logic, is a branch of logic that deals with **propositions**. A **proposition** is a statement that is either **true** or **false**, but not both. Propositional logic uses variables to represent these propositions and logical connectives (like AND, OR, NOT) to form more complex statements.

Key Components of Propositional Logic:

1. **Propositions (Atomic statements):**
   - Denoted by symbols such as p, q, r, etc., each proposition is a statement that can either be **true** or **false**.
   - Example: p: "It is raining." q: "The sun is shining."

2. **Logical Connectives:**
   - **AND (∧)**: p ∧ q is **true** if both p and q are true.
   - **OR (∨)**: p ∨ q is **true** if at least one of p or q is true.
   - **NOT (¬)**: ¬p is **true** if p is false.
   - **IMPLIES (→)**: p → q is **true** if whenever p is true, q is also true.
   - **BICONDITIONAL (↔)**: p ↔ q is **true** if both p and q have the same truth value.

3. **Truth Table:**
   - A **truth table** shows how the truth values of complex propositions are derived from the truth values of their atomic components.

4. **Syntax and Semantics:**
   - **Syntax** defines how propositions and connectives are combined to form valid statements (well-formed formulas).
   - **Semantics** provides the rules for determining the truth value of these statements.

Example of Propositional Logic Expression:

- p: "It is raining."
- q: "I am carrying an umbrella."

The statement "If it is raining, then I am carrying an umbrella" can be written as:
p → q

### Predicate Logic (PL) or First-Order Logic (FOL)

Predicate Logic, also known as first-order logic (FOL), is more expressive than propositional logic. It deals with predicates, which are functions that return a truth value, and allows for the use of **quantifiers** to express relationships and properties about objects in a domain.

Key Components of Predicate Logic:

1. **Predicates (Relations):**
   - A **predicate** is a statement about an object or objects in the domain. It can take one or more arguments.
   - Example: P(x): "x is a human." Here, P is a predicate, and x is a variable.
   - **Multi-argument** example: Loves(x, y): "x loves y."

2. **Quantifiers:**
   - **Universal quantifier (∀)**: ∀x P(x) means "For all x, P(x) is true."
   - **Existential quantifier (∃)**: ∃x P(x) means "There exists an x such that P(x) is true."

3. **Variables and Constants:**
   - **Variables** represent objects in a domain (e.g., x, y).
   - **Constants** are specific objects in the domain (e.g., John, Mary).

4. **Functions:**
   - A function maps objects to objects in the domain.
   - Example: Father(x) could represent the father of person x.

Example of Predicate Logic Expression:

- P(x): "x is a student."
- Q(x): "x studies."

The statement "For all students, if they study, they will pass the exam" can be written as:
∀x (P(x) ∧ Q(x) → R(x))

Where:
- P(x): x is a student.
- Q(x): x studies.
- R(x): x will pass the exam.

### Difference Between Propositional Logic and Predicate Logic

| **Aspect**                | **Propositional Logic**                                       | **Predicate Logic**                                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Unit**             | Propositions (simple statements)                              | Predicates (statements with variables and functions)       |
| **Variables**              | No variables are involved; propositions are atomic            | Involves variables representing objects in a domain        |
| **Quantifiers**            | No quantifiers (cannot express "for all" or "there exists")    | Uses quantifiers like ∀ (for all) and ∃ (there exists)      |
| **Expressiveness**         | Limited to fixed propositions                                 | More expressive; can describe relationships and properties |
| **Example Statement**      | "It is raining."                                              | "For all humans, they are mortal."                         |
| **Formal Structure**       | Combines atomic propositions using connectives (AND, OR, etc.) | Combines predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives   |
| **Complexity**             | Simpler and easier to understand                              | More complex and expressive for detailed reasoning          |

### Summary

- **Propositional Logic** deals with propositions that are either true or false, without involving variables or quantifiers. It is simpler but limited in what it can express.
- **Predicate Logic** introduces predicates, variables, and quantifiers, allowing it to express more complex statements about objects and their relationships within a domain.
