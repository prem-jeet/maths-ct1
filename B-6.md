# Show that if $2^n - 1$
is prime, then n is prime.

### Proof by Contradiction

1. **Assumption**: Assume $2^n - 1$ is prime, but \(n\) is not prime. This means that \(n\) can be expressed as a product of two integers greater than 1, say \(n = ab\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are both greater than 1.

2. **Rewrite the Expression**: We can express $2^n - 1$ in terms of \(a\) and \(b$:
   $$ 
   2^n - 1 = 2^{ab} - 1 
   $$

3. **Factor the Expression**: We can use the difference of squares to factor \(2^{ab} - 1\):
   $$
   2^{ab} - 1 = (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + \ldots + 2^a + 1)
   $$
   Here, $(2^a - 1)$ and $(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + \ldots + 2^a + 1$) are both integers greater than 1 when \(a, b > 1\).

4. **Conclude**: Since $2^n - 1$ can be factored into two integers greater than 1, this means that $2^n - 1$ is not prime.

5. **Contradiction**: This contradicts our original assumption that $2^n - 1$ is prime. Therefore, our assumption that \(n\) is not prime must be false.

### Conclusion

Thus, if $2^n - 1$ is prime, it must be the case that \(n\) is prime.
