# Define Logic. Define the consequence relation Turnstyle. What are the properties to be satisfied by this consequence relation of a logic?

### Definition of Logic

**Logic** is a fundamental branch of philosophy and mathematics that focuses on the principles of valid reasoning and argumentation. It provides a systematic framework for distinguishing between correct and incorrect reasoning, enabling individuals to evaluate statements and arguments effectively.

### Key Concepts in Logic:

1. **Propositions:**
   - A **proposition** is a declarative statement that can be classified as either **true** or **false**, but not both. 
   - **Example:** The statement "The sky is blue" is a proposition because it can be assessed for its truth value.

2. **Logical Connectives:**
   - Logic employs specific operators to connect propositions and form complex statements. Common logical connectives include:
     - **AND (∧)**: The conjunction is true if both statements are true.
     - **OR (∨)**: The disjunction is true if at least one of the statements is true.
     - **NOT (¬)**: The negation operator reverses the truth value of a statement.
     - **IMPLIES (→)**: This connective indicates that if one statement is true, then another statement must also be true.

3. **Arguments:**
   - An **argument** is composed of a set of propositions, known as premises, leading to a conclusion. The aim is to demonstrate that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.
   - **Example:**
     - Premise 1: "All humans are mortal."
     - Premise 2: "Socrates is a human."
     - Conclusion: "Therefore, Socrates is mortal."

4. **Validity and Soundness:**
   - An argument is termed **valid** if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. 
   - An argument is considered **sound** if it is both valid and all its premises are true.

5. **Types of Logic:**
   - Logic encompasses various branches, including:
     - **Propositional Logic**: Concerned with propositions and their combinations.
     - **Predicate Logic**: Incorporates quantifiers and predicates, allowing for more intricate statements about objects.
     - **Formal Logic**: Utilizes symbols and formal rules to express logical relationships.
     - **Informal Logic**: Focuses on analyzing everyday reasoning and arguments without strict formal rules.

### Importance of Logic:

- **Critical Thinking**: Logic enhances critical thinking skills by teaching individuals how to evaluate arguments and recognize fallacies (errors in reasoning).
- **Problem Solving**: Logical reasoning is crucial in problem-solving across various domains, including mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and law.
- **Clear Communication**: A solid understanding of logic aids in articulating ideas clearly and persuasively.

### Summary

In summary, logic is the study of correct reasoning and sound argumentation. It is an essential skill that promotes critical thinking and effective communication, making it invaluable in both academic and everyday contexts.

## Turnstyle

A **turnstile** (sometimes written as turnstyle) in computer science is a symbol or notation used primarily in **logic** and **formal proofs** to indicate the result of an implication or inference. The symbol is typically written as `⊢`.

### Basics of Turnstile (⊢) in Logic:

The turnstile symbol is used in **deductive systems** and **formal logic** to express that something can be derived or inferred from a set of assumptions or premises. It can be understood as meaning "proves" or "yields."

For a beginner, here’s a simple explanation:

1. **Left side of the turnstile (⊢)**: This side contains **premises** or **assumptions**. These are the statements we assume to be true.
   
2. **Right side of the turnstile (⊢)**: This side contains the **conclusion** or the statement we are trying to prove based on the assumptions.

### Example in Simple Terms:

Imagine you have a few facts, like:
- **Premise 1**: All humans are mortal.
- **Premise 2**: Socrates is a human.

Now, if you use **logic**, you can infer a new fact:
- **Conclusion**: Socrates is mortal.

Using the turnstile symbol, you can write this reasoning as:
\[
\text{All humans are mortal}, \text{ Socrates is a human} ⊢ \text{ Socrates is mortal}.
\]
This notation says, "Given the assumptions on the left, the conclusion on the right can be derived."

### Different Fields Using Turnstile:

1. **Propositional Logic**: Used to show that one statement can be derived from another.
   - Example: If `P` and `P → Q`, then you can conclude `Q`. This can be written as:
     \[
     P, P \rightarrow Q ⊢ Q
     \]

2. **Programming Languages**: Used in **type systems** to show that a certain expression has a certain type.
   - Example: If you have a type system where an expression `e` has type `T`, it can be written as:
     \[
     \Gamma ⊢ e : T
     \]
     Here, `Γ` represents a context or a set of assumptions about types of variables, and the turnstile says that expression `e` has type `T` in this context.

### Summary:
- **Turnstile (⊢)** is used to show that something can be logically derived from assumptions.
- It is a formal way of saying "if these premises are true, then this conclusion follows."

It's helpful to think of the turnstile as an arrow connecting "facts we know" to "things we can prove."


### Below are the main properties typically required by a consequence relation in logic:

1. Reflexivity (Identity)

   A ⊢ A

   Explanation: A formula A always implies itself.

2. Monotonicity (Weakening)

   If Γ ⊢ A, then Γ ∪ Δ ⊢ A

   Explanation: If a conclusion A can be derived from a set of premises Γ, adding more premises Δ will not invalidate the conclusion.

3. Transitivity (Cut Rule)

   If Γ ⊢ A and A ⊢ B, then Γ ⊢ B

   Explanation: If A can be derived from Γ, and B can be derived from A, then B can be directly derived from Γ.

4. Thinning (Contraction)

   If Γ, A, A ⊢ B, then Γ, A ⊢ B

   Explanation: Multiple occurrences of the same premise can be removed without affecting the conclusion.

5. Consistency (Soundness)

   If Γ ⊢ A, then A must be true whenever Γ is true.

   Explanation: A valid derivation should lead to a true conclusion if the premises are true.

6. Completeness

   If A is true in all models where Γ is true, then Γ ⊢ A.

   Explanation: If A is true in every model where Γ is true, then A should be derivable from Γ.

7. Substitution (Substitution Invariance)

   If Γ ⊢ A(x), then Γ ⊢ A(y) where y is a substitution for x.

   Explanation: Substituting a variable in a logical expression should not change the validity of the derivation.

8. Compactness

   If Γ ⊢ A, then there exists a finite subset Δ ⊆ Γ such that Δ ⊢ A.

   Explanation: If a conclusion A can be derived from an infinite set of premises Γ, there must be a finite subset Δ that leads to the same conclusion.

9. Structural Rules

   a. Exchange: Γ, A, B ⊢ C implies Γ, B, A ⊢ C

   b. Weakening: If Γ ⊢ A, then Γ, B ⊢ A

   Explanation: Structural rules allow the rearranging of premises without affecting the conclusion.

10. Negation Consistency

    It should not be possible to derive both a statement and its negation from the same set of premises.
    Γ ⊢ A and Γ ⊢ ¬A should not happen.

    Explanation: A logical system must avoid contradictions; deriving both A and ¬A would make the system inconsistent.
