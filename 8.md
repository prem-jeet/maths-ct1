# Express each of these statements using predicates, quantifiers, logical connectives, and mathematical operators where the domain consists of all integers.

## Logical Expressions

Let \( P(x) \) denote "x is a positive integer," and \( N(x) \) denote "x is a negative integer."

a. **The product of two negative integers is positive.**
   - **Logical Expression**: ∀x ∀y ((N(x) ∧ N(y)) → (x ⋅ y > 0))

b. **The average of two positive integers is positive.**
   - **Logical Expression**: ∀x ∀y ((P(x) ∧ P(y)) → ( (x + y) / 2 > 0))

c. **The difference of two negative integers is not necessarily negative.**
   - **Logical Expression**: ∃x ∃y (N(x) ∧ N(y) ∧ (x - y ≥ 0))

d. **The absolute value of the sum of two integers does not exceed the sum of the absolute values of these integers.**
   - **Logical Expression**: ∀x ∀y (|x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|)
