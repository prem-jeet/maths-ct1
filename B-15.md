### System of Congruences

You have the following congruences:

1. $ x \equiv 7 \, (\text{mod} \, 9) $
2. $ x \equiv 4 \, (\text{mod} \, 12) $
3. $ x \equiv 16 \, (\text{mod} \, 21) $

### Checking Pairwise Conditions

To apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), the moduli should be pairwise coprime. Let's examine the pairs:

1. **For \(9\) and \(12\)**:  
   - \( \text{gcd}(9, 12) = 3 \) (not coprime)
   
2. **For \(9\) and \(21\)**:  
   - \( \text{gcd}(9, 21) = 3 \) (not coprime)
   
3. **For \(12\) and \(21\)**:  
   - \( \text{gcd}(12, 21) = 3 \) (not coprime)

### Implications

Since the moduli are not pairwise coprime, we cannot directly apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, we can still find solutions if they exist by checking for consistency among the equations.

### Solving the System

To check for consistency, we can solve the first two congruences:

1. From \( x \equiv 7 \, (\text{mod} \, 9) \), we can express \( x \) as:
   \[
   x = 9k + 7 \quad \text{for some integer } k
   \]

2. Substituting this into the second congruence:
   \[
   9k + 7 \equiv 4 \, (\text{mod} \, 12)
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   9k \equiv -3 \, (\text{mod} \, 12) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 9k \equiv 9 \, (\text{mod} \, 12) \quad \Rightarrow \quad k \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 4)
   \]
   Thus, \( k = 4m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \).

3. Substituting back gives:
   \[
   x = 9(4m + 1) + 7 = 36m + 16
   \]
   So:
   \[
   x \equiv 16 \, (\text{mod} \, 36)
   \]

Now, we check against the third congruence:

\[
x \equiv 16 \, (\text{mod} \, 21)
\]

### Consistency Check

Now we can solve:

1. \( x \equiv 16 \, (\text{mod} \, 36) \)
2. \( x \equiv 16 \, (\text{mod} \, 21) \)

Both equations agree since \( 16 \) is congruent to \( 16 \) modulo both \( 36 \) and \( 21 \).

### Final Conclusion

The system is consistent, and the solution \( x \equiv 16 \, (\text{mod} \, 36) \) holds. 

Thus, the complete solution for the original system is:

\[
x = 16 + 36n \quad \text{for any integer } n
\]

This means that there are indeed valid solutions to the original set of congruences, despite the moduli not being coprime. Thank you for pointing that out!
