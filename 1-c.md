# Differentiate between the syntactic and semantic definitions of turnstyle.

### The **turnstile symbol (⊢)** is used both in the **syntactic** and **semantic** contexts of logic, but its meaning differs depending on the interpretation. Here's how the syntactic and semantic definitions of the turnstile differ:

### Syntactic Definition of Turnstile (⊢)

In the **syntactic** sense, the turnstile symbol ⊢ represents a formal derivation in a **proof system**. This indicates that a conclusion can be **derived from a set of premises** using a set of inference rules.

#### Key Features of the Syntactic Turnstile:

- It is concerned with **formal proofs** and **derivations**.
- The relation Γ ⊢ A means that the formula A can be **derived** from the set of premises Γ using the rules of the system.
- It focuses on the **mechanics of reasoning**, without any concern for the truth values of the statements.
- **Soundness** is an important property of the syntactic system, meaning that if Γ ⊢ A, then A should be **true** whenever Γ is true.

#### Example:
If Γ = {A → B, A}, then:

Γ ⊢ B

This means that B can be **derived** from the premises A → B and A, using the rules of inference.

### Semantic Definition of Turnstile (⊨)

In the **semantic** sense, the turnstile symbol ⊨ represents **logical entailment**. It expresses that a statement is **true in all models** where the premises are true.

#### Key Features of the Semantic Turnstile:

- It is concerned with **truth** and **models** rather than formal proofs.
- The relation Γ ⊨ A means that **A is true** in every model where the set of premises Γ is true.
- **Completeness** is a property associated with the semantic system, which means that if Γ ⊨ A, then it should be possible to derive A from Γ syntactically (Γ ⊢ A).

#### Example:
If Γ = {A → B, A}, then:

Γ ⊨ B

This means that in any model where both A → B and A are true, B must also be true.

### Key Differences between Syntactic and Semantic Turnstile:

1. **Syntactic Turnstile (⊢):**
   - Represents **formal derivability** using rules of inference.
   - Concerned with **proofs** and how conclusions are derived from premises.
   - Does not necessarily imply that the conclusion is true in all models.

2. **Semantic Turnstile (⊨):**
   - Represents **truth preservation** across all models.
   - Concerned with whether the premises **logically entail** the conclusion.
   - Ensures that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true in every possible interpretation.

3. **Soundness**:
   - If Γ ⊢ A, then Γ ⊨ A (everything that is syntactically provable must also be semantically true).

4. **Completeness**:
   - If Γ ⊨ A, then Γ ⊢ A (everything that is semantically true must also be syntactically provable).

### Summary

- **Syntactic turnstile (⊢)** is about **deriving** conclusions through a formal system of rules.
- **Semantic turnstile (⊨)** is about **truth** and logical entailment in all models or interpretations.
