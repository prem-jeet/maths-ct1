# What is the value of $œÜ(ùëù^k)$ when p is prime and k is a positive integer?

The value of Euler's totient function $\phi(p^k)$, where $p$ is a prime number and $k$ is a positive integer, is given by the formula:

$$
\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}
$$

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding $\phi(n)$**: The function $\phi(n)$ counts the number of integers from $1$ to $n$ that are coprime to $n$.

2. **Deriving the formula**:
   - The total number of integers from $1$ to $p^k$ is $p^k$.
   - The multiples of $p$ in this range are $p, 2p, 3p, \ldots, p^k$, which gives us $p^{k-1}$ multiples (since $p^k / p = p^{k-1}$).
   - Hence, the integers that are not multiples of $p$ (and are thus coprime to $p^k$) are:
   $$
   p^k - p^{k-1}
   $$

### Conclusion:

So, the final result is:
$$
\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = p^{k-1}(p - 1)
$$ 

This formula gives you the count of integers less than or equal to $p^k$ that are coprime to $p^k$.
