# You can upgrade your operating system only if you have a 32-bit processor running at 1GHz or faster, at least 1 GB RAM, and 16 GB free hard disk space, or a 64- bit processor running at 2 GHz or faster, at least 2 GB RAM, and at least 32 GB free hard disk space. Express you answer in terms of u: “You can upgrade your operating system,” b32 : “You have a 32-bit processor,” b64: “You have a 64-bit processor,” g1: “Your processor runs at 1 GHz or faster,” g2: “Your processor runs at 2 GHz or faster,” r1 : “Your processor has at least 1 GB RAM,” r2 : “Your processor has at least 2 GB RAM,” h16: “You have at least 16 GB free hard disk space,” and h32: “You have at least 32 GB free hard diskspace.”

Let the propositions be defined as follows:

- \( u \): You can upgrade your operating system.
- \( b_{32} \): You have a 32-bit processor.
- \( b_{64} \): You have a 64-bit processor.
- \( g_1 \): Your processor runs at 1 GHz or faster.
- \( g_2 \): Your processor runs at 2 GHz or faster.
- \( r_1 \): Your processor has at least 1 GB RAM.
- \( r_2 \): Your processor has at least 2 GB RAM.
- \( h_{16} \): You have at least 16 GB free hard disk space.
- \( h_{32} \): You have at least 32 GB free hard disk space.

### Logical Expression:

You can upgrade your operating system if and only if:

1. You have a 32-bit processor running at 1 GHz or faster, at least 1 GB RAM, and 16 GB free hard disk space, or
2. You have a 64-bit processor running at 2 GHz or faster, at least 2 GB RAM, and at least 32 GB free hard disk space.

This can be expressed logically as:

u ↔ [(b_{32} ∧ g1 ∧ r_1 ∧ h_{16}) ∨ (b_{64} ∧ g_2 ∧ r_2 ∧ h_{32})]
