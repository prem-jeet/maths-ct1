# When three professors are seated in a restaurant, the hostess asks them: “Does everyone want coffee?” The first professor says: “I do not know.” The second professor then says: “I do not know.” Finally, the third professor says: “No, not everyone wants coffee.” The hostess comes back and gives coffee to the professors who want it. How did she figure out who wanted coffee?

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **First Professor's Response**:
   - When the first professor says, "I do not know," it indicates that he is uncertain if everyone wants coffee. This uncertainty implies that he himself either wants coffee or does not want coffee, but cannot conclude definitively about the others. 
   - If he wanted coffee and knew that the second professor wanted it too, he could have confidently said that everyone wants coffee. Therefore, he must be uncertain about the second professor's desire for coffee.

2. **Second Professor's Response**:
   - The second professor also says, "I do not know." His uncertainty is telling. If he wanted coffee and knew that the first professor wanted it, he would be able to conclude that not everyone wants coffee since the first professor's uncertainty indicated that there was at least one professor who might not want coffee. 
   - Thus, the second professor's lack of knowledge implies that he, too, is uncertain about the first professor's desire for coffee.

3. **Third Professor's Response**:
   - Finally, the third professor states, "No, not everyone wants coffee." 
   - This statement resolves the uncertainty that the first two professors had. The third professor must have realized that the first two professors' responses indicated at least one of them does not want coffee. Since he was aware of this, he could conclude that not everyone wants coffee, including himself.

### Conclusion
- The hostess deduced who wanted coffee based on the logical implications of the professors' statements:
  - Since both the first and second professors did not know if everyone wanted coffee, it means they could not both be in agreement about wanting it.
  - The third professor's statement confirms that at least one of them does not want coffee. 
- Therefore, the hostess could infer that the first two professors are uncertain about their desire for coffee, while the third professor is definitively stating that at least one of them does not want it.
