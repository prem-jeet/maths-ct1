# Translate each of these statements into logical expressions using predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives.

a) Something is not in the correct place.

b) All tools are in the correct place and are in excellent condition.

c) Everything is in the correct place and in excellent condition.

d) Nothing is in the correct place and is in excellent condition.

e) One of your tools is not in the correct place, but it is in excellent condition.

### Translation of Statements into Logical Expressions

To translate the given statements into logical expressions, we will define the following predicates:

- Let \( C(x) \): "x is in the correct place."
- Let \( E(x) \): "x is in excellent condition."
- Let \( T(x) \): "x is a tool."

We will also use quantifiers:
- \( \exists \): There exists
- \( \forall \): For all

### Logical Expressions

a) **Something is not in the correct place.**
   - **Logical Expression**: \( \exists x \, \neg C(x) \)

b) **All tools are in the correct place and are in excellent condition.**
   - **Logical Expression**: \( \forall x (T(x) \rightarrow (C(x) \land E(x))) \)

c) **Everything is in the correct place and in excellent condition.**
   - **Logical Expression**: \( \forall x (C(x) \land E(x)) \)

d) **Nothing is in the correct place and is in excellent condition.**
   - **Logical Expression**: \( \forall x \, \neg (C(x) \land E(x)) \)
   - Alternatively: \( \forall x (\neg C(x) \lor \neg E(x)) \)

e) **One of your tools is not in the correct place, but it is in excellent condition.**
   - **Logical Expression**: \( \exists x (T(x) \land \neg C(x) \land E(x)) \)
