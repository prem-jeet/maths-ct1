# Define soundness and completeness of a logic. Are propositional logic and predicate logic both sound and complete?

### Soundness and Completeness of Logic

**Soundness** and **completeness** are two important properties of logical systems that help determine the reliability and effectiveness of the logical framework.

### Soundness

**Soundness** refers to the property of a logical system that ensures that if a statement can be derived from the system's axioms and inference rules, then that statement is also true in every model of the system. In simpler terms, a sound system does not allow for false conclusions to be derived from true premises.

- **Formal Definition**: A logical system is sound if, for any set of premises \( \Gamma \) and conclusion \( A \), whenever \( \Gamma \vdash A \) (i.e., \( A \) can be derived from \( \Gamma \)), it follows that \( \Gamma \models A \) (i.e., \( A \) is true in all models where \( \Gamma \) is true).
  
### Completeness

**Completeness** refers to the property of a logical system that ensures that if a statement is true in all models of the system, then it can be derived using the system's axioms and inference rules. In simpler terms, a complete system allows for the derivation of all true statements that can be expressed within its framework.

- **Formal Definition**: A logical system is complete if, for any set of premises \( \Gamma \) and conclusion \( A \), whenever \( \Gamma \models A \) (i.e., \( A \) is true in all models where \( \Gamma \) is true), it follows that \( \Gamma \vdash A \) (i.e., \( A \) can be derived from \( \Gamma \)).

### Are Propositional Logic and Predicate Logic Sound and Complete?

1. **Propositional Logic**:
   - **Soundness**: Propositional logic is sound. This means that any statement that can be derived in propositional logic is true in every model of propositional logic.
   - **Completeness**: Propositional logic is also complete. This means that any statement that is true in all models of propositional logic can be derived using the axioms and rules of inference in propositional logic.

2. **Predicate Logic**:
   - **Soundness**: Predicate logic is sound. Like propositional logic, any statement that can be derived in predicate logic is true in all models of predicate logic.
   - **Completeness**: Predicate logic is also complete. Any statement that is true in all models of predicate logic can be derived using its axioms and inference rules.

### Summary

Both propositional logic and predicate logic are characterized by the properties of soundness and completeness, meaning they are reliable systems for reasoning. Soundness ensures that only true conclusions can be drawn from premises, while completeness guarantees that all true statements can be derived within the logical framework.
