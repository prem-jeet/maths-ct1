# Let P(x), Q(x), R(x), and S(x) be the statements “x is a baby,” “x is logical,” “x is able to manage a crocodile,” and “x is despised,” respectively. Suppose that the domain consists of all people. Express each of these statements using quantifiers; logical connectives; and P(x), Q(x), R(x), and S(x).

## Logical Expressions

a. **Babies Are Illogical.**
   - **Logical Expression**: ∀x (P(x) → ¬Q(x))

b. **Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.**
   - **Logical Expression**: ∀x (R(x) → ¬S(x))

c. **Illogical persons are despised.**
   - **Logical Expression**: ∀x (¬Q(x) → S(x))

d. **Babies cannot manage crocodiles.**
   - **Logical Expression**: ∀x (P(x) → ¬R(x))
